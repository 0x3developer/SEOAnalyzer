## Decisions And Concerns
- While this project is a simple project, I tried to use exist tool like html-agility instead of working with XML.
- I decided to make it simple while there is a chance to enhance code.
- Code is tested manually and by UnitTest.


## To Improve
- In some website some words compained into one long word, its actually from the html-agility source, that part needs investigation and fix
